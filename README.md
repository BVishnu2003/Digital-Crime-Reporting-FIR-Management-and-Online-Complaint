In the contemporary digital landscape, the limitations of traditional crime reporting methods—characterized by time-consuming paperwork, restricted access for citizens in remote areas, and bureaucratic delays—necessitate the adoption of innovative technological solutions. This project presents a robust and scalable web-based platform titled Digital Crime Reporting: FIR Management and Online Complaint System, which aims to modernize the interaction between citizens and law enforcement agencies. Built using JavaServer Pages (JSP), Servlets, and a MySQL database, this platform allows individuals to file First Information Reports (FIRs) and complaints securely from any location with internet access. The system incorporates essential features such as real-time FIR submission, photo evidence uploads, status tracking, and automated PDF generation for official documentation. To enhance data security and user authentication, the platform integrates SHA-256 hashing for password protection and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption for securing sensitive data like uploaded images or digital signatures. A key aspect of the system is the admin control panel, which enables police officers to efficiently manage reports, verify citizen inputs, and update complaint statuses (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed), thereby streamlining investigation processes and reducing response times. This initiative not only promotes transparency and accountability within the law enforcement system but also aligns with the principles of E-Governance by fostering digital inclusion and improving service delivery. Ultimately, the Digital Crime Reporting platform serves as a vital step towards a more efficient, citizen-friendly, and technologically empowered legal infrastructure.
